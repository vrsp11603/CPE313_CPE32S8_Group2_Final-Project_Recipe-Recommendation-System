# Datasets

## Overview
This folder contains the details on the datasets used for training object detection model and recipe recommendation. 

## Object Detection Dataset
For object detection, dataset are composed of images of raw ingredients of a common part of Filipino cuisine. The image datasets used for this research were carefully picked and web-scraped from different web platforms such as Kaggle, OpenCv, RoboFlow, Adobe Stock, and others. The following platforms have different qualities in order for the model to broaden its scope of understanding for object detection. We have gathered 250 images per class which have 200 images for train data and 50 for test data.
