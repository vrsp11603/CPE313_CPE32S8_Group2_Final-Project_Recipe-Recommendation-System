# Deep Learning-based Ingredient Detection for a Recipe Recommendation System

## Overview
This Github repository contains the final project entitled 'Deep Learning-based Ingredient Detection for a Recipe Recommendation System' for a final deliverable for CPE 313 course - Advanced Machine Learning and Machine Learning. This project focuses on the design and implementation of a recipe recommendation system using object detection models for detecting ingredients. The primary objective of this final project is to develop recipe recommendation for optimizing food inventory.

## Introduction
Household food waste is the most damaging in terms of environmental and economic impact[^1]. Despite food insecurity, approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption is reported to be wasted. Plate waste is defined as edible portions of food which are left on the dining table or on the plates after the family has finished eating and are usually given to household pets or discarded [^2]. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.3 specifically targeted and aimed to halve plate waste and decrease food loss by 2030. 

According to the World Wildlife Fund–Philippines (2020), it is estimated that around 2,175 tons of food scraps in greater Metro Manila alone were thrown in the garbage every day in the year 2020, while around 308,000 tons around the country are being considered as food waste [^3]. Given that plate waste is mostly generated at home, the typical Filipino family generates 66.8g of plate waste each day which is 5.0g more than in 2015 [^2].
