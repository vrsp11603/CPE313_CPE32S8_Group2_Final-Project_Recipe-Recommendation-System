# YOLOv6 Models

This folder contains models and performances brought by training a YOLOv6 model.

## Overview
1. Introduction
YOLOv6 is an object detection model that offers remarkable balance between speed and accuracy, making it a popular choice for real-time applications. This model introduces several notable enhancements on its architecture and training scheme, including the implementation of a Bi-directional Concatenation (BiC) module, an anchor-aided training (AAT) strategy, and an improved backbone and neck design for state-of-the-art accuracy on the COCO dataset [^1]. It was trained under 142 layers of neural networks consisting 4,235,823 parameters.
